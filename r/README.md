Introduction
============

The empirical attainment function (EAF) describes the probabilistic
distribution of the outcomes obtained by a stochastic algorithm in the
objective space. This [R](https://www.R-project.org/) package implements plots
of summary attainment surfaces and differences between the first-order
EAFs. These plots may be used for exploring the performance of stochastic local
search algorithms for biobjective optimization problems and help in identifying
certain algorithmic behaviors in a graphical way.

The corresponding [book chapter](#LopPaqStu09emaa) [1] explains the use of
these visualization tools and illustrates them with examples arising from
practice.

In addition, the package provides functions for computing several quality metrics, such as hypervolume, IGD, IGD+, and epsilon.

**Keywords**: empirical attainment function, summary attainment surfaces, EAF
differences, multi-objective optimization, bi-objective optimization,
performance measures, performance assessment, graphical analysis,
visualization.

Download and installation
-------------------------

The **moocore** package is implemented in R. Therefore,
a basic knowledge of R is recommended to make use of all features.

The first step before installing the **moocore** package is to [install R](https://cran.r-project.org/). Once R is installed in the system, there are two methods for installing the **moocore** package:

 1. Install within R (automatic download, internet connection required). Invoke
    R, then

    ```r
        install.packages("moocore")
    ```

 2. [Download the **moocore** package from CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/package=moocore) (you may also need to download and install
    first the [package modeltools](https://cran.r-project.org/package=modeltools)), and invoke at the command-line:

    ```bash
        R CMD INSTALL <package>
    ```
    where `<package>` is one of the three versions available: `.tar.gz` (Unix/BSD/GNU/Linux), `.tgz` (MacOS X), or `.zip` (Windows).

Search the [R documentation](https://cran.r-project.org/faqs.html) if you need more help to install an R package on your system.

The code for computing the EAF is available as a C program, and it does not require installing R or any R packages.  Just [download the package source
code](https://cran.r-project.org/package=moocore), uncompress it, and look for the
directory `src/eaf`. The C code can be used to implement your own visualizations
instead of the visualizations provided by the **moocore** package. Compiled executables for computing the EAF can be found under `system.file(package="moocore", "bin")`. Other useful
executable programs can be found there.

The `moocore` package also contains two Perl scripts that may allow you to generate
standard plots without any R knowledge. See `inst/scripts/eafplot/` and
`inst/scripts/eafdiff/` in the package source code. The scripts use the **moocore**
package internally to generate the plots, and, hence, the **moocore** package must
be installed and working.


If you wish to be notified of bugfixes and new versions, please subscribe to the [low-volume emo-list](https://lists.dei.uc.pt/mailman/listinfo/emo-list), where announcements will be made.

[ [Download **moocore** package from CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/package=moocore) ]  [ [Documentation](https://mlopez-ibanez.github.io/moocore/) ]  [ [Development version (GitHub)](https://github.com/MLopez-Ibanez/moocore) ]


GitHub (Development version)
----------------------------

If you wish to try the development version, you can install it by executing the
following commands within the R console:

```R
    R> install.packages("devtools")
    R> devtools::install_github("multi-objective/moocore")
```

Usage
-----

Once the **moocore** package is installed, the following R commands will give more information:
```r
    library(moocore)
    ?eaf
    ?read_datasets
```

In addition, the source code contains the following under `src/`:
 * `src/eaf` : This C program computes the empirical attainment function in 2
   or 3 dimensions. It is NOT required by the other programs, but it is
   provided as a useful command-line utility. This version is based on the
   original code written by Carlos M. Fonseca available at
   http://www.tik.ee.ethz.ch/pisa/. A more recent version is available at [Prof. Fonseca's website](https://eden.dei.uc.pt/~cmfonsec/software.html).
 * `src/mo-tools` : Several tools for working with multi-objective data.

For more information, consult the `README` files at each subdirectory.


Python
------

There is also a Python `moocore` package: https://multi-objective.github.io/moocore/python
